What is drought?

Drought: Prolonged dry weather causing water scarcity, which can adversely affect agriculture, ecosystems, and human activities.

What is agriculture drought?

  Agricultural Drought: Prolonged dry weather with inadequate precipitation, leading to reduced crop yields, livestock losses, and negative impacts on agriculture.
  
  
  Agricultural drought, a common natural disaster in many regions, is a phenomenon that occurs when there is an extended period of inadequate soil moisture, leading to reduced crop growth and yield losses. Agricultural droughts have severe implications for farmers, rural communities, and global food security, as they can result in crop failure, reduced farm income, and increased vulnerability to poverty and hunger.
  
  
  Agricultural droughts are influenced by various factors, including climate variability, such as changes in precipitation patterns and temperature, as well as soil moisture dynamics and crop water requirements. Accurate prediction of agricultural drought is crucial for effective water resource management, crop planning, and risk mitigation strategies. Over the years, there have been significant advancements in remote sensing, climate modelling, and data analytics that have enabled the development of sophisticated techniques for agricultural drought analytics.
